  <p><small>Load shedding has become part of our daily lives affecting so many transactions especially 
  ATM based and creating long unbearable queues. Part of this mandate is that we have decided to
  bring all the unbanked sections of the society into the banking framework. However,

  In order to provide them access to banking facilities, Depozitha is where people can 
  easily send/receive money and avail banking and non-banking facilities with the 
  help of micro-ATMS and distribution partners. This system is very inclusive and may
  help distribute social grants in future.</small></p>
